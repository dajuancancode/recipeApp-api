# Recipe App API

This is a restful api for a web app that will allow users to sign up and share their favorite recipes. I am building it to help me build my knowledge of back end development with node and express. I'll be using mongoose to communicate with a mongodb database. I'll also be researching other ways of adding authentication, so that users can sign up with their social media acounts. This will probably be a long process, but I look forward to learning a lot
